  "body": "### IEEE 1901\r\nThe IEEE 1901 is a standard for high speed communication protocol via electric power lines. The 1901 standards include two different physical layers, one based on FFT orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and another based on wavelet OFDM modulation. Each PHY is optional, and implementers of the specification may, but are not required to include both. The FFT PHY is derived from HomePlug AV technology and is deployed in HomePlug-based products. The Wavelet PHY is derived from HD-PLC technology and is deployed in HD-PLC-based products.\r\n\r\n### Open IEEE 1901 Implementation\r\nThe aim of this project is to provide an open source software implementation of IEEE 1901 physical layer. The software can then be used in software-defined radio systems. On such communication systems the core components are running on a personal computer. \r\n\r\n### GNU Radio Module\r\nGNU Radio is a free software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software-defined radios and signal-processing systems. The Gr-plc is basically a C++ implementation of IEEE 1901, designed to work in GNU Radio. \r\n\r\n### Blocks\r\nThe module includes the following blocks\r\n- PHY\r\n- MAC\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
