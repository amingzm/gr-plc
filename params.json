  "body": "### IEEE 1901 in Software\r\nThe IEEE 1901 is a standard for high speed communication protocol via electric power lines. The aim of this project is to provide an open source software implementation of IEEE 1901 physical layer. The software can then be used in software-defined radio systems. \r\n\r\n### Gr-plc\r\nGr-plc is a C++ implementation of IEEE 1901, designed to work in GNU Radio. GNU Radio is a free software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software-defined radios and signal-processing systems.  \r\n\r\n### GNU Radio Blocks\r\nThe gr-plc module includes the following GNU Radio blocks:\r\n- PHY In - receives IEEE 1901 frames\r\n- PHY Out - transmits IEEE 1901 frame\r\n- PHY - an hierarchy block that includes the PHY In and PHY Out\r\n- MAC - A simple IEEE 1901 MAC layer that control the PHY block\r\n- APP In\r\n- APP Out\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nPlease see the [github page](https://github.com/roeebar/gr-plc).\r\n",
