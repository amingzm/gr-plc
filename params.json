  "body": "### Open IEEE 1901 Implementation\r\nThe IEEE 1901 is a standard for high speed communication protocol via electric power lines. The aim of this project is to provide an open source software implementation of IEEE 1901 physical layer. The software can then be used in software-defined radio systems. On such systems the core components are running on a personal computer. \r\n\r\n### Gr-plc\r\nGNU Radio is a free software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software-defined radios and signal-processing systems. Gr-plc is basically a C++ implementation of IEEE 1901, designed to work in GNU Radio. \r\n\r\n### Blocks\r\nThe module includes the following blocks\r\n- PHY\r\n- MAC\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\n",
